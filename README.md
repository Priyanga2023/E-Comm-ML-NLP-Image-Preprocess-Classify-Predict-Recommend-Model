## "E-Comm ML : NLP, Image, Preprocess, Classify, Predict, Recommend Model"

## Introduction
The E-Commerce ML project is focused on predicting and identifying potential customers in an E-commerce dataset using machine learning classification. This project incorporates Natural Language Processing (NLP), image processing, preprocessing, classification, prediction, and a recommendation model.

## Problem Statement
We aim to predict and identify visitors who are likely to convert into customers using an E-commerce dataset. The dataset includes a target variable, "has_converted," which needs to be classified to determine whether a user or a visitor will convert as a customer.

## Data files
The data files that are used for this project is available in the repository and can be accessed

## Project Steps
### Classification & Prediction
### Data Read
- Read the E-commerce dataset.

### EDA with Plots
- Utilize Streamlit for interactive visualizations.

### Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the data.

### Statistical Analysis
- Conduct statistical analysis on the preprocessed data.

### Feature Selection
- Identify and select relevant features for model building.

### Model Building
- Build at least 3 machine learning models for classification.

### Live Data Predictions
- Implement model predictions for live stream data.

### Model Evaluation
- Display precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score for each model.

### Image Preprocessing
- Read and preprocess images.
- Display pre-processed images with titles (e.g., Edge Detected Image).
- Implement OCR for text images (using Tesseract, keras-ocr, etc.).

### NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- Input text data.
- Perform NLP pre-processing.
- Show steps and outputs with names.
- Extract keywords from the text.
- Conduct sentiment analysis for the text.

### Recommendation System
- Build a product recommendation system based on the dataset.
- Allow users to input a product and receive at least 5 recommended products.
