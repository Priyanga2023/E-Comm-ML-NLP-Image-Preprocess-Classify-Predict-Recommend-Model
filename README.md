### Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Pillow (PIL)
- Tesseract (OCR)
- NLTK
- Visualization modules or packages
- And more necessary modules or packages...

### Problem Statement
Develop a comprehensive project that covers Data Classification & Prediction, Image processing, NLP, and Recommendation systems using an E-commerce dataset. The goal is to predict user conversion, explore data patterns, preprocess images, analyze text data, and recommend products.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into distinct sections, including:
- Data Classification & Prediction
- Image Processing & Classification
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Product Recommendation System

## Section 1: Data Classification & Prediction
1. Load the E-commerce dataset.
2. Perform data preprocessing and exploration.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Build and evaluate machine learning models for classification.
5. Display precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score.

## Section 2: Image Processing & Classification
1. Upload & read the Image.
2. Process the Image, and perform image pre-processing steps.
3. Display pre-processed images with titles (e.g., Resized Image, Edge Detected Image, etc.).
4. If a Text Image is uploaded, show the result of OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

## Section 3: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
1. Input a bunch of text.
2. Perform NLP pre-processing steps.
3. Showcase each step's outputs with their names.
4. Find keywords from the text.
5. Perform sentiment analysis on the text and visualize the plot.

## Section 4: Product Recommendation System
1. Build a product recommendation system using the E-commerce dataset.
2. Allow users to input a product and receive recommended products.
3. Implement recommendation algorithms.
4. Display atleast 5 recommended products.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
